# Microservices Architecture using Spring Boot and Kafka

### Hello!

This repository is based on a course for the implementation of distributed services using clean architecture and hexagonal architecture, with development support for the implementation of domain using DDD (domain-driven design), as well as CQRS, OUTBOX and SAGA patterns for transaction management, also an implementation for the communication of the various microservices by events - driven transmitted through an implementation of Apache Kafka is performed.
